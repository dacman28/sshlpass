# sshlpass
LastPass with SSH For Mac OS X and Linux (I have only tested on Fedora but others should work)

This script allows you to access your stored passwords in lastpass in ssh. The key is to make the name of the site the server you are trying to connect to. 

Simply install the script and make a sym link into a bin file (or edit your bashrc file).

This script requires sshpass and lpass cli (LastPass' command line tool)

Future Versions will include checks and instructions on installing lpass and sshpass.
